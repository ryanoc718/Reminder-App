The Reminder App allows you to create and edit reminders with gui interface. The data is stored in a text file called ReminderHistory.txt.
The task is sent to the windows task scheduler when created and a pop up with the reminder will appear at the designated time.
This project will only run on windows systems because it takes advantage of the Win32com python library for windows operating system
